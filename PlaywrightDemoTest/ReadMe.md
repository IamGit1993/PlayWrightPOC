# Playwright Project

## Overview
This repository contains an automation testing framework built using **Playwright with Java, Maven, and Cucumber**. The project is designed to provide a structured and scalable solution for UI automation, leveraging the power of Playwright for cross-browser testing.

## Features
- **Playwright for UI automation** across multiple browsers.
- **Java and Maven** for dependency management and build execution.
- **Cucumber BDD integration** for behavior-driven testing.
- **Structured test framework** with reusable components.
- **Easy-to-maintain test scripts** with clear reporting and logging mechanisms.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install **Java (JDK 11 or later)**
- Install **Maven**
- Install **Node.js** (required for Playwright)
- Install required dependencies using Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn clean install
  ```

### Running Tests
To execute the test suite, use the following command:
```sh
mvn test
```
For running specific feature files:
```sh
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/features/yourFeatureFile.feature"
```
